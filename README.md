This is a primitive blog application.
The aim of the project is to have a minimalistic yet extensible fullstack project template in case needed.
Frontend and backend loosely coupled.
I tried to keep the project layout as clean as possible
Following technologies are used:

  - Python / Django Rest Framework for API
  - JS/ React-Redux for Frontend
  - Docker for container
